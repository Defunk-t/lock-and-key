## Status

This project is currently under early development. As such, it is subject to change drastically and break horribly. You should probably use something more mature like [KeeWeb](https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb).

# About

Lock & Key is a password management application built in Electron around the [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org) library. It is built to use key-based asymmetric encryption to manage and store secrets, such as usernames and passwords, locally on your device.
